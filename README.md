# Coursera-Capstone

This repository includes the files I used for my final project in the IBM Data Science Professional Certification, a nine-part course 
on the Coursera platform. I compared similarities between neighborhoods in Seattle and Portland using statistical techniques and 
mapped them for a visual display of neighborhood similarities between the two PNW cities.
